# Tool-Based JSON Mode (Legacy)

This document describes the original tool-based fact accumulation architecture. The repository now uses the Strands `FactOutput` structured-output model directly (see [JSON_MODE_FEATURE.md](JSON_MODE_FEATURE.md) for the current behavior). Keep this file for historical context only; all active development happens in the structured output pipeline.
